		<p>I am a native of Rochester, New York, although I haven't lived here all my life.  In the 1980s I played in various rock â€˜n roll bands and traveled around the Northeast United States and parts of Canada.  When that career lost its luster, I went back to college at Syracuse University and earned a degree in Library Sciences.  After moving back to Rochester, getting married and having kids, I started working my way through Xerox management.  In the early 2000s I began the Master of Business Administration (MBA) program at RIT. I only made it half way through the MBA program before I dropped-out to attend RIT's new School of Information Technology, which is where I learned to love the Web.  Upon completing the Master of Information Technology program (paid for by Xerox!) I left the company to pursue my new dream of Web development.</p>
