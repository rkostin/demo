		<p>Fresh out of school (and out of Xerox) I started my new career as a freelancer, working alone, and then later teaming up with other freelancers to build a portfolio of websites.  Based on my portfolio I was able to start my contract consulting career.  At that time (late 2000s), mobile Web development was becoming a thing, so I taught myself as much as I could in that area of the industry and billed myself as a mobile development expert.  That helped me get my first few contracts, which led to more contracts.  Soon I had a lucrative second career that made me much happier (and better off) than my previous corporate marketing career.</p>
