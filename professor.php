		<p>Around 2010, I picked-up a night course to teach entry-level web development.  The pay was not great, and it took up way more time than it should have, but I suppose I wanted to do it because it was my way of giving back to the community.  For reasons - I'm not sure why - I kept teaching night courses semester after semester, and I started doing fewer and fewer contract jobs.  By 2013, when I started as an adjunct at UR, I was teaching at four colleges at once, and I had (almost) stopped working as a consultant entirely.  </p>

		<p>Adjunct pay is not very good and running between colleges is stressful (and expensive! ...lots of gas).  When an opportunity at UR came up to become a full-time lecturer for the new Digital Media Studies program, I dropped all my other adjunct positions at the other colleges and stopped my contract consulting jobs entirely to devote myself to my new, third career: teaching.</p>
